                </div>
                <p class="body-text">The peripheral nervous system consists of countless bundles of neurons called nerves. A portion of these contain sensory neurons, which respond to some stimulus in the sensory organs. For example, the inner ear contains many of these nerves, which react in response to loud noises. The peripheral nervous system also consists of motor neurons, which give muscles information on when to contract and relax. 
                    The central nervous system is located in the brain and spinal cord. It is composed primarily of interneurons, which assist with the processing of information by forming complex circuits with each other. These circuits determine how the body should react in response to stimulus from sensory neurons, informing the correct muscle neurons to trigger. This system controls unconscious responses; in response to a sudden loud noise, the central nervous system will trigger the appropriate muscles to cover one’s ears or protect one’s face. It is also responsible for conscious thought; these circuits govern not just the interpretation of sound as speech, but also our emotional, congnitive, and verbal reactions to speech.</p>

                <p class="body-text">Neural cells have tails called axons, which are coated in a lipid bilayer similar to the cell body. Axons are generally a bit longer than the cell itself, but some can extend up to a meter long when transmitting information between distant parts of the body. The end of the axon, called the synapse, forks into several axon terminals. Synapses attach to the cell bodies of other neurons, and transmit information to the target cell.</p>

                <p class="main-idea">Neurons change their electric charge by adjusting the concentration of ions inside and outside of their cell membrane.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body-text">Unlike many cells in the body, neurons actively maintain a difference in electric charge between their interiors and their surroundings. This difference is called the neuron’s membrane potential. The membrane potential while the cell is at rest (called the resting potential) is around -60 to -80 mV. This charge is maintained by moving sodium and potassium ions across the cellular membrane using ion channels: proteins which selectively allow cations to pass through while blocking their corresponding anions. By increasing the concentration of KCl inside of the cell, for example, and heating it slightly, some KCl will temporarily split into K+ and Cl-. The K+ is allowed across the cellular membrane, while the Cl- stays inside, generating a net negative membrane potential through the difference in the charge of the ions. NaCl goes the opposite way; the positive Na+ ions seep inside the cell, creating a positive charge. While at rest, the cell does this slightly more with K+ than Na+, keeping it negatively charged, but adjusting the effectiveness of either type of ion channel can adjust this charge to whatever is required.</p>

                <p class="main-idea">If a neuron is depolarized enough, the cell reacts and generates a positive spike in charge called an action potential.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body-text">While at rest, neurons have a net negative charge; however, applying a positive current or adjusting ion concentrations can hyperpolarize (make more negative) or depolarize (equalize) the cell’s charge. Depolarizing a neuron to around -55 mV triggers proteins called voltage-activated ion pumps, which continuously move ions until the cell reaches around +55 mV. This spike in charge is called an action potential. After the charge peaks, the ion pumps deactivate and the cell returns to its original charge, entering a short refectory period during which it cannot be triggered again.</p>
                
                <p class="main-idea">Action potentials travel along axons, potentially triggering other neurons.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body-text">When a cell reaches action potential, the change in ions and voltage triggers more voltage-activated ion pumps in the base of the axon, causing the same rise in voltage, which triggers more pumps further down the axon, which in turn trigger even more in a chain reaction travelling down the axon. This charge eventually reaches the synapse: if the synapse is connected to another neuron, this current can also be passed to this cell as well.</p>
                
                <p class="main-idea">In response to an action potential, synapses can introduce chemicals called neurotransmitters into other neurons, polarizing or depolarizing them.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body-text">When an action potential reaches a synapse, the synapse can also release chemicals called neurotransmitters, which enable or prevent proteins called ligand-gated ion channels from moving ions. By manipulating these ion pumps, these neurotransmitters polarize or depolarize the cell, and are referred to as having an "inhibitory" or "excitatory postsynaptic potential", respectively. Repeated postsynaptic potentials from the same or different synapses can assist or interfere with each other, adding another level of logic as to under which conditions the target neuron can fire.</p>
